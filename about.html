            <h1> About </h1>
            <p>
                This website aims to present some of my works and reflections,
                mainly revolving around scientific computing, maths and physics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Amongst the sources of joy and excitement in my life are the discovery of new topics and skills,
                nature either through contemplation or physical activity,
                and music in its diversity.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm an obsessive problem-solver when it comes to creating and crafting things,
                I love and need to totally immerse myself in a topic when it picks up my interest.
            </p>

            <h1> Wooden spoons </h1>
            I like to sculpt green wood with an hatchet and a knife to make wooden spoons.

            <h1> European Trees </h1>
            I'm quite interested in indigenous trees and learnt to recognize most of them.
            Below is an hybrid oak (Quercus Ilex Quercus Pyrenaica) three raised from the seed that I collected during my bike trip.

        <div  class="theme" id="bike">
            <h1> Bicycle trip </h1>
            After using my bike for commuting for a while, I realised that it could be easy to cycle to Spain.
            I choose to go to the Systema Central.
            I sewed bags for the frame, put a tent older than me back into service,
            and after saving a little money I took the opportunity to go.
            I never really had the occasion to travel, so it was a blast.
