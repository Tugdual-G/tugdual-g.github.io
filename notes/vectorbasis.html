        <h1> Covariant and contravariant vectors </h1>

        <p>
          When working with curvilinear or arbitrary coordinate systems
          some problems are better described in therms of covariant or contravariant vectors.
          For example, the conservation laws in geophysical fluid dynamics.
        </p>

        <p>
          These notes explains the relation between coordinates systems and their basis vector in order
          to highligth the differences between covariant and contravariant vectors.
        </p>

        <h2> Coordinates are made of scalar fields </h2>
        <section>
            <p>
              It is usefull to recall that each coordinate's component is just a scalar field.
              It is a trivial fact, but that is the easiest way to understand what covariant
              and contravariant vector really are.
            </p>

            <p>
              A common way of representing a coordinate system is to draw a grid.
              A grid is made from the isolines of the coordinates fields, i.e,
              the \(x\) grid lines are the isolines of \(x\).
            </p>

            <p>
              If the coordinate system is orthogonal,
              the \(x\) grid lines are locally tangent to the gradient of the \(y\) field.
            </p>
        </section>

        <h2> Vector basis </h2>
        <section>
          <p>
            Lets take a vector \(v\) in a two dimensional space.
            We want \(v\) to represent a spacial quantity
            which should not depends on the way we measure space.
          </p>

          <p>
            We can use a reference coordinate system,
            let say the Cartesian coordinates \((x, y)\) ,
            and the associated vector basis \((e_x, e_y)\).
          </p>

          <p>
            We can also use another arbitrary coordinate system,
            with the coordinates \((q^1 , q^2)\), and the vector basis \((e_1, e_2)\).
            This arbitrary coordinate system can be later transformed as we like.
            We do not know yet how to obtain the vector basis, but it doesn't matter.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Cartesian coordinates will be used as a reference, i.e.
            the components of \(v\) will not change in the Cartesian system.
            Why would we need that ?
            Because otherwise, how would we know that something changed without any reference ?
            But we have yet to create a vector basis in order to express the components of \(v\).
          </p>

          <p>
            There are two main ways of building a vector basis from a given coordinate system,
            note that those basis can be local.
            Let's try both.
          </p>

          <h3> Tangent vectors and contravariant components </h3>
          <section>
            <p>
              The most common way to obtain a basis is to take the derivative of the position of a point,
              \[ e_i = \frac{\partial \vec{r}}{\partial q^i} \]
            </p>

            <p>
              This yield vectors which are tangent to the other coordinate's isolines
              (isosurfaces in 3D).
            </p>

            <p>
            The components of \(v\)  are written \(v^i\) and thus,

            \[v = v^1 e_1 + v^2 e_2 \]
            </p>


            <p>
              Now, what will happen if we divide the whole field \(q^1\) by two ?
              We can see that the length of \(e_1\)  will be multiplied by two.
              \(v\) should stay the same, so the component \(v^1\) will be divided by two.
              That's why the components \(v^i\) are called <i>contravariant</i> (relatively to the basis \(e_i\), and,
              \(v^1 e_1 + v^2 e_2\) is called a contravariant vector.
              Contravariant components are written with upper indices.
            </p>
          </section>

          <h3> Gradient vectors and covariant components </h3>
          <section>

            <p>
              We can use the gradient of each coordinate to build another Vector basis for \((q^1, q^2)\),
              \[e^i = \nabla q^i \]
            </p>

            <p>
              But how is the gradient defined ?
              We could use our reference Cartesian basis to assess how \((q^1, q^2)\) and \((x, y)\) are related.
              However, we should not really care, since the gradient field doesn't depends on the coordinate system, and we do not need its expression.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thus, the vector \(v\) can be written,
              \[v = v_1 e^1 + v_2 e^2\]
            </p>


            <p>
              Again, we divide the field \(q^1\) by two.
              We see that the length of \(e^1\) will also be divided by two.
              In consequence, the component \(v_1\) has to be multiplied by two.
              That's the contrary of the previous basis.
            </p>


            <p>
              So we say that the components \(v_i\) are <i>covariant</i> (relatively to the previous basis \(e_i\)),
              and that \(v_1 e^1 + v_2 e^2\) is a covariant vector.
              Covariant components are written with lower indices.
            </p>
          </section>
        </section>

        <h2> Conclusion </h2>
        <section>
        <p>
          The name covariant and contravariant are given relatively to the \(e_i\) basis.
          If we apply a transform \(M\) to the \(e_i\) basis,

          <ul>
            <li>
                the contravariant components must undergo the inverse transform, \(M^{-1}\).
            </li>
            <li>
                the covariant components must undergo the same transform, \(M\).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          Moreover, we see that the basis vectors \(e^i\) are contravariant,
          and that the \(e_i\) are covariant (relatively to themselves).
        </p>

        <p>
          The basis for covariant vectors is made from the contravariant vectors \(e^i\) .
          That way the vector \(v\) stays the same after the transformations of \(e_i\).
        </p>

        <p>
          In the same fashion,
          the basis for contravariant vectors is made from the covariant vectors \(e_i\) .
        </p>
