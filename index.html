            <h1> About </h1>
            <p>
                This website aims to present myself, share knowledge and reflections
                on subjects mainly revolving around scientific computing, math, and physics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Among the sources of joy and excitement in my life are the discovery of new topics and skills,
                nature, either through contemplation or physical activity,
                and music in its diversity.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am an obsessive problem-solver when it comes to creating and crafting things,
                I love and need to totally immerse myself in a topic when it picks up my interest.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you think that I might be interested and useful in any sort of project,
                feel free to reach me on LikedIn !

            <h1> Wooden spoons </h1>
            I sometimes carve green wood with a hatchet and a knife to make wooden spoons.
            I see it as a meditative and relaxing activity where you focus on shape,
            grain direction, and not cutting your fingers off.
            They make great gifts too.

            I'm quite interested in French/Europeans indigenous trees and have learned to recognize most of them.

            <h1> Bicycle trip </h1>
            After commuting with my bike for a while, I realized that it would be nice to cycle to Spain.
            I choose to go to the Sistema Central and Sistema Iberico,
            making my way in the mountain ranges surrounding Soria.
            Indeed, I appreciate mountains and remote places,
            even if it was going to be a bit challenging in terms of supply, weather and road quality.
            I sewed bags for the frame, put a tent older than me back into service,
            and after saving a little money, I took the opportunity to go.
            I never really had the occasion to travel, so it was a blast.

            <h1>Code</h1>
            <p>
                I have been learning to code mostly as a hobby, by trying to model and compute simple physical phenomena.
            </p>
            <p>
                While studying physics, I became interested in fluid dynamics and decided to implement my own little vorticity-based modelisation.
                This led me to participate in other fluid dynamics projects where I learned the importance of implementation strategies,
                version control, and testing.
            </p>

            <p>
                My favorite languages to work with are:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>C++ >= 17 </b> : I love C, but recent C++ is nicer to use on bigger projects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Python </b> : Intuitive, fast to write, and can be fast enough for many applications,
                        when using the right tools.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                You can find many projects along with their presentations on my

        <div  class="theme" id="linux">
            <h1>GNU/Linux</h1>
            <p>
                GNU/Linux provides a highly customizable environment
                and is resource-efficient,
                meaning that using a pc with 4Gb of RAM is totally fine for most applications.
            </p>

            <p>
                I do not use any desktop environment and rely on the command-line for common operations,
                although I highly recommend implementing some kind of
                <a href="notes/clicheatsheet.html"><b>cheat-sheet quick search</b></a> system in that case.
            </p>

            <h2> Emacs </h2>
            <p>
                Emacs is my main IDE ( with the Vim key bindings ).
                I'm not a hardcore Emacs user, and do not want to invest too much time in learning it,
                so I use Doom-Emacs and I'm really satisfied with it.
                The org mode is incredibly simple of usage and powerful,
                way more ergonomic than LaTeX if you need to write math.
            </p>
            <h2> Git </h2>
            <p>
                You should use Git for every project.
            </p>
