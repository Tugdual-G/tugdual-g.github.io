            <h1> About </h1>
            <p>
                This website aims to present myself, share knowledge and reflexions,
                with subjects mainly revolving around scientific computing, maths and physics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Amongst the sources of joy and excitement in my life are the discovery of new topics and skills,
                nature, either through contemplation or physical activity,
                and music in its diversity.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm an obsessive problem-solver when it comes to creating and crafting things,
                I love and need to totally immerse myself in a topic when it picks up my interest.
            </p>
            <p>
                This website may make me look like a jack-of-all-trades,
                but that's really not the case, as a matter of fact,
                each of the presented subjects corresponds to a limited and dedicated time span.
                Some of these skills have already begun to fade-out, some will stay for longer.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you think that I might be interested and usefull in any sort of project,
                feel free to reach me on Likedin !

            <h1> Wooden spoons </h1>
            I sometimes carve green wood with an hatchet and a knife to make wooden spoons.
            I see it as a meditative and relaxing activity where you focus on shape,
            fibers direction, and not cutting your fingers off.
            They make great gifts too.

            I'm quite interested in french/europeans indigenous trees and learnt to recognize most of them.
            Below is an hybrid oak
            three raised from the seeds that I collected during my bike trip in Spain.

            <h1> Bicycle trip </h1>
            After commuting with my bike for a while, I realised that it would be nice to cycle to Spain.
            I choose to go to the Sistema Central and Sistema Iberico,
            making my way in the moutain ranges surrounding Soria.
            Indeed, I appreciate mountains and remotes places,
            even if it was going to be a bit challenging in terms of supply, weather and road roughness.
            I sewed bags for the frame, put a tent older than me back into service,
            and after saving a little money I took the opportunity to go.
            I never really had the occasion to travel, so it was a blast.

        <div  class="theme" id="code">
            <h1>Code</h1>
            I learnt to code mostly as a hobby, by trying to model and compute simple physical phenomena.
            While studying physics, I became interested in fluid dynamics and decided to implement my own little vorticity-based modelisation.
            This led me to participate in other fluid dynamics projects where I learnt the importance of implementation strategies,
            version control, and testing.

            My favorites langages to work with are:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>C++ >= 17 </b> : I love C, but recent C++ is nicer to use on bigger projects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Python </b> : Intuitive, fast to write, and can be fast enougth for many applications,
                    when using the right tools.
                </li>
            </ul>
            You can found many projects along with their presentations on my
